\title{Prediction functions for piecewise constant hazard regression}
\usage{
\method{predict}{survSL.pchreg}(object, newX, new.times, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Fitted \code{survSL.pchreg} object.}

\item{newX}{New covariate data.frame for which to obtain predictions.}

\item{new.times}{Times at which to obtain to obtain the predicted survivals.}

\item{...}{Additional ignored arguments.}
}
\value{
Matrix of predictions, with the same number of rows as \code{newX} and number of columns equal to the length of \code{new.times}. Rows index new observations, and columns index new times at which the survival was computed.
}
\description{
Obtains predicted survivals from a fitted piecewise constant hazard regression object.
